                Five Nights at Freddy's 2 is taken place in the new establishment called Freddy Fazbear's Pizza in 1987, prequel to FNAF 1.
                The new night guard, Jeremy Fitzgerald, faces new toy animatronics and originals that look a little worn out, all possessed by
                murdered children's spirits. While playing this game, you will unravel the horrors behind this place, such as: William Afton's killings
                through selected mini-games and phone calls, the infamous Bite of '87 and the restaurant's eventual failure with corporate cover-ups and the 
                tragic cycle of haunted animatronics. As you play each night, you will piece together how the once beloved pizzeria turned into a nightmare.

            <p>
                Mini-games tell the story of William Afton's murders and many have major significance to the story.
            </p>
            <p>
                This one rare mini-game tells the story of one of the children's murders. Charlotte Emily was the daughter of Henry Emily, who was once a 
                work partner with William. Charlotte was locked out of the pizzeria on a cold, rainy night. The other children weren't sure how to help, so they
                left her outside, while the Puppet was helpless, being locked inside of a present. As soon as the Puppet was able to leave the present box, it
                immediately rushed outside to realize it was too late. Charlotte was dead by the hands of William Afton, outside the pizzeria on the rainy night.
                Charlotte's spirit eventually possessed the Puppet, and that is where Charlotte resides now. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Another mini-game shows a purple humanoid figure, we know as William Afton. He is shown in multiple mini-games that he lures children into the 
                back of the pizzeria to murder them in cold blood. He has murdered several children and has caused the Missing Children Incident (MCI). He is the main cause 
                of the missing children and the spirits that are locked in the animatronic's bodies.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a mini-game called "Save Them", The Puppet tries to save the souls that were murdered by the hands of William. They try to
                saving their souls by putting them into the animatronics themselves, which causes the main reason on how the animatronics are alive
                and able to move on their own in the first place.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Bite of '87 is hinted in the game multiple times. During a birthday party, a malfunctioning animatronic, as we know as Mangle, bit a vistor's 
                frontal lobe. The visitor survived but had permanent brain damage from the incident. The Bite of '87 was the cause of restricting
                animatronics from daytime roaming.
            </p>

                You play as Jeremy Fitzgerald. As you survive the nights, you unravel more and more horrible secrets about this place. Along side you is your phone.
                You will get calls from Phone Guy, but some might be mysterious and... suspicious. Can you survive all 5 nights? A reminder... Fazbear Entertainment is not
                responsible for any deaths or dismemberment in the pizzeria. You are on your own. Have a great time!
