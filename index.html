                            <p>Five Nights at Freddy's 2 is apart of a 10-12 horror game series. It is an independent <br>point-and-click 
                                survival game. 
                            </p>
                            <p>The old, aging, and broken original cast is now joined by a brand new set of characters.<br> Very kid-friendly 
                                and a new facial recognition tech! What could go wrong?
                            </p>
                            <p>As the new night guard of this establishment, you have to make sure nothing goes wrong<br> during after-hours. 
                                The previous guard had many complaints about the animatronics <br>getting into the office. To make your job easier,
                                Fazbear Entertainment has provided you with<br> your own empty Freddy head! The characters should be able to leave you
                                alone once you<br> put on the mask. With their facial recognition code, they should recognize you as one of<br> them. Surely you will
                                be fine!
                            </p>
                            <p>As always, Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for any death or dismemberment.<br> Stay safe, and have the best 5 nights of your life!</p>
