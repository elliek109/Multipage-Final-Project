                My daughter, if you can hear me, I knew you would return as well.
                It's in your nature to protect the innocent. I'm sorry that on that day, the day you were shut out
                and left to die, no one was there to life you up into their arms the way you lifted
                others into yours. And then, what became of you? I should've known you wouldn't be content to disappear.
                Not my daughter. I couldn't save you then, so let me save you now. It is time to rest. For you, and for those
                you have carried in your arms. This ends for all of us. End communication.
            </p>
